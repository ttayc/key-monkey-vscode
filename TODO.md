# TODO

- add more stats -- total time, character stats
- some sort of scroll system so only <5 lines are shown at a time and they automatically scroll
- add timer mode

- add code/code snippets mode
- differentiate between most common 200, 1000 words

## bugs

- if viewport is too narrow, can't scroll up to stats or menu

## maybe

- add timeout if user takes too long (forgot about test in background)
- persist configuration across instances
- speed/errors stats and graph

# Done
